# Team Schedule

## Week One (Feb 11 - Feb 18)

1. Research the use of Command Line Interface (CLI).
2. Define methods:
    * retrieve branches from a repo
    * retrieve usernames from branches
3. Determine if PyGithub or PyDriller would work best for the given methods,
   implement the one that works best.
4. Build a basic CLI with the above features. 

### Demo Week One: Basic Command Line Interface Using Tools and Two Methods

## Week Two (Feb 18 - Feb 25)

1. Ensure correct tool (PyDriller or PyGuthub) is used in the methods.
2. Define methods:
    * retrieve user input from terminal that defines what the "average" level
      of commits are (anything above the average "code hoarding")
3. Continue building the CLI with the new features for the week.

### Demo Week Two: Completed Command Line Interface

## Week Three (Feb 25 - March 3)


## Week Four (March 3 - March 10)

## Project Due March 13, 230 PM

* Extra time in the event of issues
* Testing of the full system

### Goal:
Completed online interface that functions correctly and meets the requests
of the customer, pulled into master with entire system.

## End Goal

An online interface that identifies if an individual falls under the category
of "code hoarder" or "domain expert", and if there are individuals who
collaborate too often or not enough.
