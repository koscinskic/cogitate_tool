# Team Interactions Schedule

## Week One (Feb 11 - Feb 18): Due at noon on Monday, 2/17

1. Research the use of Command Line Interface (CLI).
2. Define methods:
    * retrieve branches from a repo
    * retrieve usernames from branches
3. Determine if PyGithub or PyDriller would work best for the given methods,
   implement the one that works best.
4. Build a basic CLI with the above features.

### Demo Week One: Basic Command Line Interface Using Tools and Two Methods

## Week Two (Feb 18 - Feb 25): Due at noon on Monday, 2/24

1. Ensure correct tool (PyDriller or PyGuthub) is used in the methods.
2. Define methods:
    * retrieve user input from terminal that defines what the "average" level
      of commits are (anything above the average "code hoarding")
    * compares the number of commits a user has in each branch and file to
      the set average
    * sends notification to the user when an individual has a high number
      of commits on a branch or file
    * pairs every user to everyone else and counts the number of times they
      both make commits to the same branch,
    * pairs every user to everyone else and counts the number of times they
      both make commits to the same file
    * send notification to the user when an individual has a number of
      collaborations with a specific person, beyond the average
    Note: these methods are meant to analyze the data collected by the
    Individual Metrics team
3. Continue building the CLI with the new features for the week.

### Demo Week Two: Completed Command Line Interface

## Week Three (Feb 25 - March 3): Due at noon on Monday, 3/03

1. Determine Streamlit is the best tool for an online interface.
2. Begin implementation of a basic online interface.
3. Define methods: (similiar to those in the CLI)
    * retrieve branches from repo
    * retrieve usernames from branches
    * retrieve user input from terminal that defines what the "average" level
      of commits are (anything above the average "code hoarding")
4. Integrate the other tools used in the CLI into the online interface.

### Demo Week Three: Basic Online Interface

## Week Four (March 3 - March 10): Due at noon on Monday, 3/10

1. Define methods: (similiar to those in the CLI)
    * compares the number of commits a user has in each branch and file to
      the set average
    * sends notification to the user when an individual has a high number
      of commits on a branch or file
      pairs every user to everyone else and counts the number of times they
        both make commits to the same branch,
    * pairs every user to everyone else and counts the number of times they
      both make commits to the same file
    * send notification to the user when an individual has a number of
      collaborations with a specific person, beyond the average
2. Improve existing features in the online interface

### Demo Week Four: Completed Online Interface

## Project Due March 13, 230 PM

* Extra time in the event of issues
* Testing of the full system

### Goal:
Completed online interface that functions correctly and meets the requests
of the customer, pulled into master with entire system.

## End Goal

An online interface that identifies if an individual falls under the category
of "code hoarder" or "domain expert", and if there are individuals who
collaborate too often or not enough. This is done through analyzing the data
collected by the Individual Metrics team.
